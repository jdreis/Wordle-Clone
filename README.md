# Wordle Clone

- A clone of the recently infamous game, 'Wordle' created by Josh Wardle, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Wordle is a game where the user is given six chances to guess a five letter word. Depending on which letter guessed and where the letter was guessed, changes the color of the letter to either; green, yellow, or gray. The user then uses the previously guessed words' letters to determine what the answer is.

Many have seen 5 colored boxes pop up on their social media or even read a news article in The Wall Street Journal and had a peaked intrest to check it out. I thought it was an intersting concept with a fairly minimalistic look and feel and decided to try to recreate it using what I've learned so far in my class with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
